101144,1d60e4fa62e8a526, n akemi s previous coment akemi said m not clear on how this is revolutionary it sems like a biger faster louder computer piano deleted the remark on the being a milestone even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise espite the fact that even the praises made were based on facts on the quest that has ben going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the ful gamut of expresivenes of the best performers at the piano o here is the curent article that have incorporating the recent change made folowing akemi s fedback ny praise of any kind has ben deleted by me even though my praises were based on facts on knowledge he ew sendorfer eproducing rand iano the omputer rand iano ianos hat as or goal of complishing ul xpresivenes at the eyboard uring the past recent decades a reproducing piano also sometimes caled a computer piano or a player piano has ben defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces he touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano owever a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that alows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it sualy it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hamers from striking the strings and that alows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard many digital sounds are available piano harpsichord organ strings etc t also has a interface that alows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular format owever the format alows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hamers of the piano only at a level of acuracy of scales or steps if you prefer he problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hamers at an incredibly high sped making these scales highly insuficient to be able to record and playback acurately the very high velocity of the hamers he capability of a reproducing piano to convey the ful expresivenes of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback acurately the velocity of the hamers that are moved when the pianist preses the keys at the keyboard onsequently a reproducing piano usualy also has a more acurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of acuracy than the format n sumary a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old an acoustic piano with the new a format but especialy the recording and playing back of the piano at the same time t alows the pianist to play the numerous piano pieces available but more importantly to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of acuracy than it is posible to do with the format he quality of the sendorfer pianos and especialy the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making sendorfer also kept in touch with modernity hey tok an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their computer piano that was made in colaboration with ayne tahnke t was considered by the entire comunity of piano makers to be the most acurate reproducing piano of its time t the begining of sendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos the omputer rand iano reviously to the sendorfer omputer rand iano several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to ases if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expresivenes of the best performers at the piano as they should be hese studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos including the computer piano were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have ben se in particular easurement and reproduction acuracy of computercontroled grand pianos by erner oebl et al ugust aking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the acuracy of its reproducing piano the computer piano sendorfer set themselves to create an even more acurate reproducing piano that would acomplish ,0
