84606,e26018c59a2d0ef8, fags it had ben six years since we had graduated from colege and for the first time since graduation al thre of us were together again from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the diner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had pased and we had kept in contact the comfort and atraction betwen the thre of us when al together in the same physical location was stil undeniable having returned to my cozy semi secluded home in the suburbs we al sat in the living rom siping wine and continuing the tales of our lives with the exceptions of the location a house and the presence of alcohol it could have ben any of our final two years of colege together the thre of us tight knit friends with benefits siting and chating and sharing a drink together then justine and beth had ben romates while i lived in another dorm acros the main quad now they were much welcomed guests who had fortunately ben able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a wekend as i sat in the recliner and tok another sip of wine i alowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work the florida sun had certainly aded a glow to justine s skin and may have also ben responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder length brown hair as when we were in colege together she wore virtualy no make up just a thin glos upon her lips an enticing strawbery flavor as i had discovered upon meting her at the airport earlier in the evening and red fingernails her red dres was inded elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permited a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which beth and i both certainly apreciated the long slit up the skirt of the dres revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the wel toned thigh the red hels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly atract the eyes surprisingly however she wore hop earings something she had never worn during colege for fear that they would pul at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe the conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chating primarily to each other i tok the oportunity to once again study beth and was equaly impresed while noticeably shorter than justine beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtualy every waking moment inside to conduct her research as in colege beth prefered the color black for her outfits a somewhat tight sweater form fiting slacks and a pair of low hels four tiny earings adorned each ear plus she bore a smal sparkling stud against her left nostril beth s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine it felt so god to be in their presence once again especialy since al thre of us had ben in several failed relationships since graduating from colege i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the wekend with me i had absolutely no doubt that our chater would eventualy give way to intimacy but for now i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stuning beauties perched upon the sofa the intimacy began when we finaly went to bed together i was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder an arm wraped around each of them i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest diped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typicaly wore to bed caresed my stifening manhod my eyes closed i reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet ful of rediscovery due to the lengthy pasage of time no words were neded and as their hands ocasionaly made contact with each other upon me i smiled to myself in the darknes having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters but eventualy their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing faling into the regularity asociated with slep i stayed awake a litle longer imensely enjoying the closenes with two of the people who had ben most important in my life i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast cofe faint yet unmistakable justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while beth and i held each other as she slept the fel of her pajama covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation as it had ben over a year since,0

44376,76850b688779e105, cite example if you have some sort of idea why editing the roman polanski to include the title of rapist is disruptive or vandalism you should explain why instead of just unilateraly deciding that it is you should cite more than just you think it is and explain specificaly why you think that it is there are many other wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many diferent things one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts these articles include titles like rapist criminal pedophile murderer thief organized crime bos and many others just lok at the oj simpson article it makes reference to acusations against him for murder in the first sentence where this title is sems to be at isue for some reason wikipdeia articles are usualy vastly diferent in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in diferent places throughout the articles since there is no debate as to whether roman polanski is a rapist or not and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie carer should it not be included in the first sentence is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed should a person s most prominent title be their carer their ethnicity place of origin or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life what specific guideline specifies this should it merely be what the person is best known for because roman polanski is very wel known for having raped a year old girl and for being a movie director many people would say he is not known for his acting as he has few notable roles or writing as he has writen very litle but these titles apear in the first sentence of his article ,0

82810,dd8d8eaf7f639f63, please just think about what you re saying here let s take this by the numbers firstly quite frankly i am disapointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the difs and information i posted at user talk black kite your sugestion that highking should step back from this type of edit is quite frankly going to be ignored again as his edits on the automobile asociation showed his admision that he has a problem sounds depresingly familiar after years of being unable to contain this problem himself and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it stil exists then coming as it did of the back of yet more of the usual eroneous defences duplicitous denials and improper deflections is surely wholy unsatisfactory s close was both abusive and counter productive he closed a perfectly valid complaint based on completely irelevant reasons namely my status further below and on his talk page if i had not presed him about it on his talk page he wouldn t have even bothered to notify you about it and you would never have even heard about s actions at the automobile asociation your charge of harasment is frankly ridiculous al i have done with this acount is make factual statements about highking s curent and past behaviour which you yourself have just repeated today is stil problematic i am obviously not the ip user he was edit waring with i never engaged with highking i never reverted highking i never threatened or personaly atacked highking al i did was coment on the situation in a factual maner in the hope other admins would take action in your absence if me making this sort of contribution spoils highking s enjoyment of wikipedia who the hel cares quite frankly it s simply not harasment if highking was to turn into a model editor tomorow then he d never hear me talking about him ever again that s not harasment it s practicaly the job description of a wikipedia admin your block for evading scrutiny it is entirely pointles enforcement of wp sock long ago stoped being about what s god for wikipedia in many instances as this block shows whatever my history whether this is a legitimate or ilegitimate alternate acount whether i m blocked or baned whatever there isn t a single thing that i could posibly be hiding that would make the edits this acount performed lok any les valid to an outside observer nothing that might be or could be revealed about me would change their meaning or relevance and it certainly wouldn t make them any more true the idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tel the truth on wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous a view no admin should be sen within a hundred miles of holding let alone repeating taking together there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block and so it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy and on the isue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harasment charges you don t even know for sure if this is an ilegitimate sock you don t know if i have a regular acount or if i m blocked or baned you re just guesing for al you know i might be using an undeclared alternate acount because i myself might have previously ben the victim of harasment from highking and so i would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my regular acount is when comenting on him in future and given the fact that as this block shows being critical of highking is semingly enough to get someone tared with a charge of conducting a long term campaign of harasment without any actual evidence whatsoever then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in god standing would not want to expose their main acount to that sort of smear as the price of simply comenting on highking to expand on the socking isue rather than being an inapropriate use of a sock when it comes to highking i think its self evident given his past using a sock when comenting on his behaviour at a venue like ani is highly apropriate as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations namely trying to deflect atention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done whether it is even relevant or not and inded whether it is even true or not his habit for example of makin,0

77419,cf6a472c193f4b45, firstly please i l apreciate if you wil use colons to format your responce properly in the same way i ve done for you that makes the thread more readable gona quote your ansewers just don t edit my posts i don t like this re ija ofensive yes i think the usr had no chances against the whole axis in the case if britain and the us never existed however in this case the axis would never formed hitler was very suspicious of japan and there would be no germano japanese aliance i think it would be realy dificult stil it canot be said it would be imposible i m not saying that confractuations are facts my goal is try kep this whole thing in the confractuation zone therefore mather of personal opinion only you that are trying to put confractuations as facts and the use of britain and the us never existed was to much in my view they could simple have remained neutral while the axis fought against the soviets regarding the japanese decision not to atack the usr in dec and dec they did plan to do so in the case of major soviet defeats under moscow or stalingrad however that hadn t hapen and the role of the western alies was minimal in that in adition as some scholars believe the khalkhin gol nomonhan leson was duly learnt by the ija staf minimal stalin loved the oil embargo that rosevelt put in japan it could have ben this very factor that saved his neck the japanese were a military government and both the army and navy did put presure for their atacks the atack in the in the pacific was purely desesperation if rosevelt didn t mather with the soviets it was just question to give the japanese their oil and god wil to put them against stalin however at this time the us was already alied with the soviet cause and i don t remember were i read now but the us embasador even treath the japanese embasador in a conversation if they launched an atack against the usr about nomonhan the ija staf learned some serious lesons on how to fight the soviets with it the army never give up of the idea of atack the usr even the navy had some simpaty for the cause if it s advance in the pacific would not be halted war betwen the two countries was probably inevitable get rid of the comunist treat was one of the largest security problems for japan matsuoka s secretary coments this in the world at war banzai episodie he said but when an integration against the north parted oil the army naturaly joined up with the navy obviosly only for maintein the war in china and could fight the soviets in the future because the critical resources neded batle of the bulge please clarify why you don t se the aspects of the batle from the alied side why the soviets can lose like they did in barbarosa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital intelectuals like you and the causes of one suposed les than expected performance the western alies not be batles are won by several factors anacronism is not nice here the western alies win in the bulge the soviet suces in bagration for instance was not garanted when it was launched it could had end up much worse than in the bulge with even defeat re lend lease yes the soviets could produce everything they neded lok the link i posted above the importance of the lend lease is wel ilustrated also no lend lease les material produced more casualities for the soviet side they would resist this and the combined ofensive of al the axis powers pehaps isn t i m just trying to point al this is something of imposible complexity and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions that means about german tanks were not built and what crew was suposed to drive these tanks germany had a desperate situation with personel due to the eastern front perhaps they wouldn t have if they could master their forces there from the start also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems produced even more refined weapons and this includes weapons of mas destruction i m here to fight with you as long as i can but one thing you already admit you don t belive the usr could hold al the axis countries together repeating i said this would be much dificult but not imposible just don t want confractuations as truth wars are like plane crash investigation it s usualy not one or the big factor but several of them together ,0

134299,ce1e69844c86f213, lary sanger has the same diagnosis that i do i have more to ofer in terms of how to solve the problem but not whilst being blocked by trols and their pet admins for making the efort wikipedia has to its credit done something about the most serious troling and other kinds of abuse there is an arbitration comite that provides a proces whereby the most disruptive users of wikipedia can be ejected from the project but there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation let alone arbitration a few of the project s participants can be not to put a nice word on it prety nasty and this is tolerated so for any person who can and wants to work politely with wel meaning rational reasonably wel informed peoplewhich is to say to be sure most people working on wikipediathe constant fighting can be so of puting as to drive them away from the project this explains why i am gone it also explains why many others including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people have left the project the rot problem anti elitism or lack of respect for expertise there is a deper problemor i at least regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above elaborated problems namely as a comunity wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise as a comunity far from being elitist which would in this context mean excluding the unwashed mases it is anti elitist which in this context means that expertise is not acorded any special respect and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated this is one of my failures a policy that i atempted to institute in wikipedia s first year but for which i did not muster adequate suport was the policy of respecting and defering politely to experts those who were there wil i hope remember that i tried very hard i ned not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventualy withered and died ultimately it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbegining with jimy wales who hired me to start a fre encyclopedia project and who now manages wikipedia and wikimediawere decidedly anti elitist in the above described sense consequently nearly everyone with much expertise but litle patience wil avoid editing wikipedia because they wilat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discusion pages against atacks by nonexperts this is not perhaps so bad in itself but if the expert should have the gal to complain to the comunity about the problem he or she wil be shouted down at worst or politely asked to work with persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable at best this lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culed version of wikipedia one that i think would not directly afect the way the main project is run but because project participants have such a horor of the traditional deference to expertise this sort of proposal has never ben taken very seriously by most wikipedians leading the project now and so much the worse for wikipedia and its reputation this lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise there would necesarily be very litle patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project this is perhaps not obvious so let me explain to atact and retain the participation of experts there would have to be litle patience for those who do not understand or agre with wikipedia s mision or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge colectively probably the most disruptive group of al a les tolerant atitude toward disruption would make the project more polite welcoming and inded open to the vast majority of inteligent wel meaning people on the internet as it is there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project though there are some of course than there could and should be it wil probably be objected by some that since i am not comited to the most radical sort of openes i do not understand why the project that i founded works it works i wil be told precisely because it is radicaly openeven anarchical i know of course that wikipedia works because it is radicaly open i recognized that as son as anyone inded it was part of the original plan but i firmly disagre with the notion that that wikipedia fert,0

50296,867423026dc63324, fresh start alright neil let s try from the begining again hopefuly with a beter result this time the genseiry karate do international federation article is clearly being vandalized by mario roering as he removes links and references from the article with false reasoning example here the link clearly shows that the bok exist and who the author is here mario roering removes yet another reference even though the reference clearly states that this is the first bok ever here mario roering ads a link to a taido site with an esay on the history of taido not genseiryu thus irelevant on the isue of genseiryu this reference has some corect dates some corect information but is at best only a colection of information found on the internet from various other sources and is as wel ful of equaly incorect information mario roering does not cite any phrase of the esay and he does not provide any reasons for why this reference should be beter than the one already included thus this is not a researched esay or document also taido is siding with the wgkf and suporting them as can be sen on many pictures and even the agrement of the establishment of the wgkf at best this reference is a none suported none factual and partial esay and like it says it is an esay on taido not genseiryu as a third party reference this is not valid many of the things mario roering has disputed in the great many earlier edits is among others that kunihiko tosa president of the gkif was not the first student of the founder seiken shukumine but in this esay it says that he started taking lesons from the founder in one year prior to the establishment of genseiryu in the esays mentions that kunihiko tosa published a some bok on genseiryu which is i gues the reason for mario roering to include this source using this argument as a counterargument to my source and claim is the same as leaving it up to me to prof a negative that kunihiko tosa wrote and published a bok on genseiryu in is confirmed in the esay as wel as other sources included by me but it does not say that the bok is the first ever on genseiryu as i mentioned above this is like saying that when something is not mentioned it is not so which of course canot be laid down as fact or suport for removing my claim as this bok being the first ever on genseiryu another point is that if mario roering wants to include this esay as a valid reference he must acept al the postulates in the esay also the ones that he has disputed many times before but wel i gues that wil not hapen thus this reference should be discarded as it is not trustworthy as a reference but merely a colection of information found on the internet the author is not named could not find it anyway and the sources used in this esay are not listed here mario roering deletes a valuable link to a reference part of kunihiko tosa s bok writen in in this bok the founder of genseiryu seiken shukumine wrote a preface and he co authored the bok as a technical advisor as wel as he himself recognized this bok as being genseiryu the reference is thus a valid one but it is my opinion that mario roering wants this left out simply because this contradicts his own views and his perception of what is the true genseiryu in mario roering s world he would fel a lot beter if this bok and the preface by the founder would simply go away like go back in a time machine and make sure it was never published mario roering has claimed on more than one ocasion that we the gkif are not doing genseiryu but only that the wgkf is this bok clearly shows that the founder aproved and suported kunihiko tosa as genseiryu thus the contradictions clearly stands out it is obvious that mario roering wants it left out simply because it shows that his claims are untrue and imposible to prof and that it is thus easier to simply get this claim removed here mario roering wants to provoke me by asking for citation it is obvious that this information originates from an interview i had with the author kunihiko tosa the information has ben put there t,0
