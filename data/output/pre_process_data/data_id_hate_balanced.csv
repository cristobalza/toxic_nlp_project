63746,aa8f84a11fcd36bf, wel dear ahasuerus it is actualy dificult to edit any page in wikipedia without muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with al sorts of excuses you must understand that the fredom of spech for muslims is an alien concept in islamic countries if you say something against islam they kil you where they can t kil you they censor you wikipedia sems to be dominated by muslims this of course is not true in al the pages where muslims have no interest but when the interest of islam comes in they can be quite bulish in making their word prevail but that is another story this article started with some explanation like this in recent years especialy after the some observers including muslim disidents have stated that islam presents a threat biger than nazism not to just the western world but to al non islamic countries they have labeled those who defend islam and try to be politicaly corect about it the today s useful idiots ali sina states they are idiots because they speak without knowledge of islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non muslim countries and destroy them from within the same author writes more abhorent than war is making peace with evil in the words of the century british parliamentarian edmund burke al that is necesary for evil to triumph is for god men to do nothing those who advocate peace with islam are idiots of this century if we do not stand against islam it wil grow and then bilions wil die trying to apease muslims is folish it is informed by ignorance of islam most cancers are treatable if detected in time but if ignored they wil grow to a stage that wil kil you today we have the choice we can either fight islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses muslims obviously don t like ali sina for some reason anything you post here from him they wil delete at once so the above pasage that explained the concept was deleted the administrator slimvirgin despite claiming impartiality has yet to show that in actions i could be wrong but for reasons that i explained to her i have stil to be convinced of that claim i found out that she is iranian like ali sina but of course most iranians are stil muslims she even once tried to discredit ali sina saying that he is islamophobic obviously she ses genuine criticism of islam unwaranted and interprets that as islamophobia my judgement about her is just based on my first impresion and i could be wrong i have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and i hope she wil eventualy show i had misjudged her in wikipedia there is a lot of islamic propaganda which are not true at al but generaly critical views about islam do not survive why if wikipedia is impartial shouldn t we give equal space to both sides would we acept if e g scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the wikipedia and disalow any criticism of their cult what is hapening is very disturbing there are hundreds of pages in wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controled by muslims and as son as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even cal your contribution hate spech what about the quran isn t that bok a hate spech funy thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules if you try to write anything that muslims don t like they wil delete it with invalid justifications this is a very disturbing trend for example the quotes of ali sina were removed because as they said he is not notable there are pages talking about faith fredom international there have ben death threats in islamic sites against him there are a few islamic sites created just to refute him doesn t al that say that he is notable at least to be quoted finaly if he is notable enough to have a page in wikipedia why his quotes should not be published i am not familiar with the structure of wikipedia but i supose there must be some comite that would check into complaints al i am hoping is that this comite is not already taken over by islamists is there a forum where important questions such as the direction wikipedia is taking is discused sory this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things i would like to discus is there a place to do that my point is that if wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion it loses its credibility fast ,1

82861,ddb5960618b9a4bd,philatelic categorization helo can you please bear with me re the categories as i have a masive amount of data to input unfortunately i do not have very much time to spend on the project and al my data has to be reformated to met wikipedia s taging standard i have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is ned for a systematic aproach a friend who is a postal expert but only an ocasional computer user told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles i am an it profesional and even i strugled to make any sense of the category structure there should be a single rot category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrela term for the entire pursuit philately itself is a hoby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub category of those wider categories i found that philately had such as postage stamps postal markings and postal history as sub categories but philately was also a sub category of each of those which is nonsense and does not help new users equaly similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised acros the board instead of being alocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non it people like my friend can easily navigate after i made a few amendments to the philatelic postal categories i asked my friend to try again and he found what he was loking for imediately this is the benefit of a structured systematic aproach whereas philately is the rot it splits into two main sub categories one of these is philately per se which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps e g watermarks types of paper gums etc the other aspect is the actual isue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is al done at the behest of a postal authority on the chicken before eg principle anything to do with isuing stamps and organising colection sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub category along with physical philately the term postal authority is a catchal for any organisation that has isued stamps and procesed mail national government army of ocupation foreign postal agency etc having said al that i agre that it is a god idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country s isues and on that basis postage stamps should be a sub category of philately there is a clear diference betwen the two disciplines i wil endeavour to make use of that diference especialy as our inputs wil fal into both of those categories as i say please bear with us as we have a masive input to make and it wil take some time to acomplish ,0

90208,f167800df10c2bf9, thank you if a country s position on the mater receives significant coverage in high quality secondary sourcing mainstream media and scholarly works it is worth inclusion it s basicaly the standard for wp weight i ve ben proposing for a while now except that i ofered to adhere to a more strict two reliable sources rule i note that what langus points out is also of relevance to establish the importance of such a section being present in the article irondome the source you presented is a god one to give an idea of the weight asigned to the international position on the isue it doesn t mean we should base the entire section on that article or only articles from that source in fact we should not the more articles from reliable sources the beter the problem with atempting to come up with a sumary like you propose is that it would be very dificult to come to an agrement in this case short mentions of individual or grouped as to avoid listing positions could prove to be les prone to atract never ending discusions this is what i sugest al in one single section with separated paragraphs international position title opening paragraph about the disparity in pro argentinian and pro british positions being voiced properly sourced and neutral un resolutions briefly mainly the un does not recognize the islanders as having a right to self determination hence britain continualy rejects the repeated un s cals for resolving the isue through dialog with argentina mention of the us and eu neutral positions the monroe doctrine should be moved to another part of the article as to not extend the us position to much as major international players the fact that the islands are listed as a british oct by the eu and the comonwealth should be mentioned to mention of the majority of latin american states backing argentina as per article presented by irondome the article presented by me and this article acesible here section china should be aded here to being another major international player finaly spain s position should be mentioned and also its similar isue with gibraltar although editors have previously oposed any mention of gibraltar here i stil think it is worth of mentioning that s my proposal and i am of course open to hear coments and or corections it should end up being quite shorter than the curent section and easier to source to regards ,0

56133,95fb875639eb6ffc,ok that s valid i ve always loked at the se also section as an area where you put stuf that people who hit the page might also be interested in seing i think i may have a fundamentaly diferent understanding of that section than you guys do or than the comunity at large might i personaly found list of cetaceans to be handy in the past its sems like to me that people doing research would be able to do it more easily if they have aces to more information in the form of more obvious sugested links that wil help people hop from page to page i don t think that people are going to be aproaching these animals en mas usualy they wil lok at one animal and if there is a link there like list of cetaceans or cetacean conservation center they wil have a very easy recomended in to do more research and learn about what amazing creatures these are clicking these links in a se also section realy helped me personaly to have aces to information which lead me to love these particular marine mamals and i want other people to have more oportunities to get more information i think list of cetaceans should be included because cetaceans links to a diferent page i would like to se cetacean conservation center go in but i understand if my felow wikipedians find that to be redundant i can se why dolphin research center is redundant after a while i think these two links would be helpful for a person loking at only one animal but i can se why they might be redundant if people are loking at many dolphins should these be included what about marine biology could that be included there are things link linking the cove film to dolphins that exist in the costal waters of japan that i realy think should be included because is discuses an isue critical to the preservation of the species there is a big diference betwen criticaly endangered and extinct which neds to be apreciated when presenting facts discused in any context about a species or ecosystem ,0

106145,37dca195eec5adc9, i am pleased that others have joined this enquiry but i am already dismayed to find that someone has found it necesary to swep the jewish question under the carpet when reference on this talk page had already ben made to one incident involving a final solution of the jews in england i like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to germany in the and it was the pasage of the so caled race laws of the that led to the holocaust of the there was a cause and efect now with that preface out of the way i am stating that the magna carta contains the smoking gun of england s own move to rid the isles of the jews this is not hiden history but wel documented history it is just not talked about because the english i am english don t want to be thought of as being antisemitic but english history reks of antisemitism what is not being adresed here and even les now that someone has aded the censor s touch is that the pope of rome there were other popes controled england through his king church and law there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the church and the church was the one church based in rome i hope everyone knows about henry vi so that i don t have to explain that as wel so the jews were moneychangers why were they moneychangers go and do your own research you ned to know the jews had a moneychanger relationship with the church and that is why the clause is in there the jews were are not christians duh not members of the church of rome the pope gave them special status the representative for al of the wheler dealing was the archbishop the barons were merely local gangsters or in today s understanding warlords thugs the statements about the jews in magna carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the jews were everyone knew who the jews were they were the people of the blod libel they kiled jesus the church whose jesus the jews kiled put up with them like the nazis used jews when it suited them and some jews a few went along with the nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of jews this is the thorny isue we are dealing with under english law the jews were forbiden to do practicaly anything else but be moneychangers they were the scum of society and the church had a ned for a sub clas of human beings the jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the jews were murdered and abused because of the holier than thou atitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today the english do not want to admit that they were at it long before her hitler got into the busines now move along to and bingo no jews why because they were kicked out of england forced to go underground or convert same thing hapened in spain helo isn t that what hapened in nazi germany it was not until the time of cromwel long after henry vi told the pope bye bye and long after shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending jew that cromwel talked about religious toleration why because cromwel ruled the english republic which had severed its relationship with the church by choping of the head of the king abolishing the house of lords and raiding al of the church properties to put them out of busines then the forces of the republic went to ireland and engaged in ethnic cleansing by wholesale murder and mayhem read your history move up to the time of century and read about the status of jews in parliament how and when they were finaly alowed to sit in parliament the botom line the magna carta of neds to be explained who wrote it and why and what it says and why what we have here on wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing but by loking at the clauses dealing with the jews you can se that while the english may get on their high horses and yel about the evil germans remember the uk royals are german are hiding under another name since wi then it is posible to gulp and say me to in english and understand that evil knows no race or religion dec utc ,0

142494,fa29262dfadb5c52, the subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing the subject of homophobia is in short the fear or hatred of gays or discrimination or prejudice against them the afa is a recognized part of a body of groups people and ideas that define modern day homophobia there s no way you can deny that even if you believe that the label is undeserved that the label could be pejorative in a non encyclopedic context or that somehow being categorized under homophobia and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as homophobic organization the categories homophobic organization and homophobe were deleted because they are gramaticaly constructed to specificaly modify or describe the subject in question homophobia is not and these false analogies may make it sem like we re out go get the afa but we aren t although sam sems to think it s an irelevant personal coment it is the case hal that since you got here you ve ben arguing that the afa s opinion of itself should more of a part of the article and that criticism should not be miles have ben spun about how much of a big deal this is that we re gay activists that we re creating atack articles that the category homophobia is a pejorative atack on whatever it labels now sam i know you l insist on removing this part of my coment editing censoring others coments is a practice that is by the way fairly dubious but remember that we are suposed to discus the isue at hand not the character of others i m not atacking hal s character but his history of editing for the sake of the afa is completely relevant to this discusion and a part of the isue at hand it explains why he believes we ve constructed an atack article hardly why the category is a pejorative atack or acusation clearly not and why it must be eventualy removed i agre with hal it could be taken as a pejorative and what concerns me is that it is but only as far as i can tel by someone who s made it clear that portraying the afa in a positive light is very important no mater wp undue what that entails ,0

151436,7cfc6ecdb320f1e7, utc ideas for improving the article great article i tok the liberty of replacing u modifier leter smal l in the article with u modifier leter vertical line where it is used to indicate a stresed sylable the former character is incorect since although it apears as a vertical line in sans serif fonts it actualy apears like a superscript lowercase l or a superscript in serif fonts like charis sil and doulos sil i only noticed this because i have a cs hack that aplies to al uses of the ipa template and forces a diferent font for them i m taking phonology at u hawai at m noa so i l be sure to ad anything interesting about hawaian that comes up oh crap didn t even catch that i hope i haven t done it elsewhere wel like i said i only noticed it because i have a cs hack in place i only wish that the rest of the world had the sil ipa fonts instaled again glad you like the article the replacement symbol you used loked alright to me but so did the original symbol it s a stretch to claim t he former character is incorect on the basis of its apearance in fonts that of users do not have most people have never heard of the sumer institute for linguistics the character that i used to mark sylable stres is the one that wikipedia presents for use in the ipa list of symbols below the edit box so if you fel you have a beter symbol then you should contact wikipedians who are in a position to consider implementing your sugestion s you might try brion viber if you learn something new about hawaian phonology at uh do let us know but remember wikipedia does not want anything that is not already published so if it s new it might be unpublished and therefore undesirable under wikipedia policy the font used to display the characters is unimportant their character encodings are specific on the basis of the two unicode names i argue that u modifier leter smal l is inapropriate as the stres marker in ipa checking the apropriate unicode chart on their website i find that u modifier leter vertical line is listed under the section miscelaneous phonetic modifiers with the coment primary stres downstep precedes leter or sylable modified on the other hand u modifier leter smal l is given in the section aditions based on ipa just below u modifier leter smal gama which has the coment these modifier leters are ocasionaly used in transcription of africates so it s fairly clear that the unicode standard makes a distinction betwen their intended purposes i note that in the botom of the edit box the two are given in sequence with u imediately folowing u it s easily posible to pres the first of the two acidentaly i wil bring this up at m help talk special characters and ask someone to reorder them for clarity your explanation and argument sounds god i don t know the layout of the insert box characters on other users screns when i edit the ipa characters are displayed in two lines the first line ends with tiny lowercase superscripts h w a j like character gama lefty glotal n the second line begins with the character i used for stres mark folowed by other stres marks length mark something to obscure to make out a mid height black square aparently used to mark the end of a series of related symbols and then the line ends with the double curly bracketed ipa based on your explanation it apears that the first line of ipa characters is broken in a way that misled me into thinking that the last member of the series of superscripts is the first member of a series of stres marks bad line break and there is no mid height black square nor significant white space separating the superscript series from the stres mark series not seing that previously i used the first mark because it loks the same as the second but darker of course it also hapened because a tiny superscripted sans serif l loks nearly identical to a tiny superscripted vertical line if you have the motivation maybe you can sugest more than just reordering in your comunication with the special characters people the adition of a separation character betwen the series of superscripts and the series of stres marks wil help here s my best sugestion to ofer on this mater persuade the special characters folks to implement apropriate new text for the ho,0

148573,4edb5bc7f1a357e6,i ve also loked at shervink s sources and i find them al to be either biased inaplicable or unreliable in my opinion shervink is advocating a minority viewpoint perhaps he should expres within the article and note it as such but clearly it is not reasonable to expect this view to be represented equaly with generaly acepted facts i fel that this is mostly a wel writen and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointles these events are acepted by most sources to have ben a coup what this means is that mosadeq is acepted to have ben the leader of iran at the time in question and to have ben deposed the phrase counter coup implies that mosadeq deposed the shah first which acording to the ample scholarship cited in this article is not what hapened it is of course posible that the concensus of scholarship on this isue is in eror but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition holders of minority viewpoints that said i do think shervink s views are interesting and should be included and noted as a minority viewpoint in the article this isue is generaly sen as the west vs iran with the shah on the side of the west a point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard itsafarce,0

75505,c9f50042add21291, edit that sparked controversy there is no consensus for a reverted edit that i made in this article hereafter the reverted edit therefore i have not changed this article unilateraly back to my previous version because that would be against consensus this reverted edit was reverted by kilerchihuahua kc who not only disagred with it but also said in her edit sumary that the edit was disruptive i disagre with kc that the edit should have ben reverted for reasons already explained above i also disagre with kc that this edit was disruptive and i wil now fuly and carefuly explain why for the record this edit that kc reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at wikipedia and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive edit war this discusion of rcog s position on choice started at the article on fetal pain and i moved it here for valid reasons at the fetal pain article kc wrote please provide a source that this government institution is pro choice abortion is legal in the uk and that the oficial govt chartered colege are to make that safe is not pro choice i therefore investigated and learned that rcog is not a government institution that most of their members live outside the uk that its governing documents do not specificaly limit its activities that many of its members do not have medical degres et cetera so i concluded that the best place to deal with al of this would be here at the article on the royal colege of obstetricians and gynaecologists here at the rcog article i aded quite a bit of info in adition to rcog s abortion stance when i was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this rcog article i repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discusion i did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article kc has elsewhere cited five difs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtualy the same as several contested asertions i had made previously here are kc s five difs in the fetal pain article in the fetal pain article in this rcog article in this rcog article and in this rcog article none of these five previous edits cited by kc is the same or virtualy the same as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy both kc s dif and dif show where i inserted a cite to suport another editor s asertion that rcog is a pro choice group kc pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think rcog was a pro choice group even though she thought rcog could have a pro choice position on particular isues there is no uncertainty or ambiguity that kc argued rcog may have a pro choice,0

4508,0bfff060f5d85f86, my reply that you have deleted in a fascist maner from the nicosia discusion page l nicosia and discrimination against grek contributors and the grek character of the citydear salvio you have acused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on nicosia for a hour period may i draw to your atention that it is fairly obvious that those thre users namely seb and chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are al clearly hailing form turkish backgrounds there is a constant undermining of the city s grek identity i e whenever a grek flag apears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of shame and ocupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal ocupation of the island of cyprus by the turkish army the grek flag is omnipresent in the republic of cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an encyclopedia that wishes to be unbiased should depict the reality and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views on the other hand such users do find it apropriate to throw in pictures using the turkish and the ilegal yes ilegal acording to united nation referendums flat of the non recognised internationaly ilegal self proclaimed state of the so caled trnc it is totaly unaceptable to have extremist nationalistic individuals that strategicaly reached the level of administrators deteriorating al the time the article on the city of nicosia promoting an unrealistic turkish character and undermining the grek character of the city and at the same time having an aditional article on north nicosia that is depicting a totaly false picture w r t the city the trnc is ilegal not recognised by any state other than turkey and some terorist states that are non democratic and yet wikipedia has a page on northern nicosia by suposedly administrators that suport the unification of cyprus this is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification canot have a separate page on northern nicosia stresing how turkish it is and then go and literaly destroy everything in the proper page for nicosia and emphasize the turkish character of the city talk about the tension and the division of the city al the time and undermine the grek character this is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable grek character of the area controled by the republic of cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the republic of cyprus the mere fact that wikipedia has a site that is constantly vandalised by several ethnic turkish extremists and wikipedia users suport such discriminatory behaviour in the light of al of this i shal stop contributing to wikipedia as i consider it downgrading for my own self furthermore i do not wish to participate in an encyclopedic project that is totaly biased and discriminatory marcobadoti talk ,0

89752,f0192dd650784496, old talk please do not ad computer rpgs here they are already listed in computer role playing games article nov utc should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like rpg rpg listings wel there are also listings in the subgenre articles so i think we should merge them jan utc i think the more useful distinction is betwen role playing games and role playing generaly i m taking the later from this page and making a new page just for the more general case also note that i use role playing as the generic term more comonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in webster s new world colege dictionary moreover i am adopting the role playing game usage hyphen betwen role and playing in order to folow that convention and because it makes sense gramaticaly hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun however i am thinking that role play game folows comon usage beter than role playing game but i m not going to redirect the page now anyway dec no one i know of and i know lots of gamers says role play game it s always role playing game and i am sure that s the most comon usage not to sound like a nerd or anything but white wolf is not strictly speaking a role playing game they are a publisher their role playing game universe world of darknes encompases betwen and or so depending on how you count them role playing games ok i m realy not that much of a nerd ok maybe just a bit dec utc i aded the notable rpg developers and publishers heading for links to companies and maybe individual creators dec utc isn t batletech more a table top war game and not an rpg i have never played it but isn t there mechwarior which is an rpg based on batletech s world jan utc batletech was purely wargame then mechwarior was made to turn it into an rpg however they are basicaly the same thing mechwarior is like ad ds player handbok and batletech rules are simply the rules for combat batletech being more complex than ad d batletech is notable from other rpgs in that corectly played one s character is as mortal as al the enemies one fights so usualy you die its basicaly a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign and most people generaly have the comander of their forces represent themselves thus an rpg and a wargame also its comon for the gm or dm to be replaced by a clasical refere and then the players instead of playing as a team go to war with each other batletech was a miniatures game based on japanese anime in the mech genre later a set of rules was developed that alowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign batletech was published fasa which is now out of busines along with batletech fasa also published games such as behind enemy lines world war two skirmish game shadowrun cyberpunk magic returns roleplaying and earthdawn fantasy roleplaying at present both batletech and earthdawn have found new publishers for a list of rpgs i recomend trying the yaho and gogle directories you wil find listings for literaly hundreds of games have fun finaly when i have it composed i wil be uploading an esay on roleplaying games and why they realy aren t games at al at least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants hope this finds you al wel feb utc sounds interesting but remember that wikipedia tries to maintain a neutral point of view it may be beter to simply provide a link to your esay feb utc meriam webster s definition of game includes as its first entry activity engaged in for diversion or amusement and then equates it with play dictionary com defines again as the first entry a game as being an activity providing entertainment or amusement just by these two references alone and you l find similar in any god dictionary atempts to declare role playing games as somet,0

23504,3e0cfcfdc9447a90, page rebuild for quite some time the alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorect information i m in the proces of rewriting it to met contemporary scientific standards for the disease i welcome external review and discusion stuart gitlow md chief anenberg physician training program in adictive disease mount sinai schol of medicine nyc thanks for your contributions so far you may be interested in creating a user acount some of the benefits are discused at this page wikipedia why create an acount it greatly reduces the chances people wil revert your changes for one thing god points and i ve created an acount as you sugest se my notes below as wel sg in response to the comentary at the very very botom of this page dupe social impacts i ve rearanged the content of the page a bit i believe that it now beter reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people definition efects diagnoses treatment broader isues fyi i renamed the first instance of social isues to read societal isues and moved it into the broader isues area i moved the later one up to become a subheading of the efects category after this edit i m going to go remove the original note of this because it s no longer germain so you l have to lok at the next edit in order to read it in loking over the article and the discusion of stanton pele s perspective et al i m wondering whether some of the ongoing discusion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to excesive drinking whatever that is alcoholism doesn t refer to someone who drinks a lot many people drink a great deal but aren t alcoholic conversely many alcoholics don t drink very much at al compared against the general population s intake the section on terminology that you removed was intended to adres exactly this misunderstanding since you sem to think it s important i m puting it back in righto despite the dificulties that we ve had of late the entry is coming together nicely i m loking over the efects section which has a god deal of information on alcohol itself and the impact of alcohol use it is dificult to tease out the efects of alcoholism versus the efects of alcohol the efects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery for example would be diferent from the efects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis this is similar of course to the situation with other diseases the efects of diabetes when an individual has wel controled blod glucoses are diferent from the efects of untreated diabetes nevertheles i wonder whether the entire section would be more apropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article can we build a consensus regarding this area alcoholism vs alcohol abuse the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism make a diference betwen one and the other what i found more confusing is that from alcohol abuse you re redirected to alcoholism alcoholism also known as alcohol dependence is a disease that includes four symptoms craving los of control physical dependence and tolerance moreover alcohol abuse difers from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol los of control over drinking or physical dependence etc etc geting the facts nia response god point from one interested perspective a literature itself discuses this isue and draws a clear distinction betwen alcohol abuse and alcoholism i can t make the corection i m not that god informed and my english is quite lousy could you how about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug adiction corect me if i m wrong but alcohol is certainly a hard drug characterized by intense and posibly fatal withdrawals isn t that adiction this is mostly true the rot,0

142826,fbd98a475bfb3746, this is the memo that i meant by the way my german apears realy realy realy bad the german version apears to be copied from the usa version of course this is just one of many memos betwen the participants i note that the memos that you put forward however sem to show that the jewish problem was being handled in ways other than gas chambers ie deportation or sterilization both rather extreme injustices but not deadly a litle reading shows that hitler himler etc could be quite squimish about kiling people ie the wiki article night and fog sugests as much there has ben atempts to question this memo s provenace however this memo is just one of several that folow the same theme leave the jewish problem alone at least til the war is over if there was any gasing or any murder of jews it was being done behind hitler s back and the backs of any loyal ambitious hitlerites a not very plausible scenario but the one the memos would force on believers the memo i meant was mr reich minister lamers informed me that the f hrer had repeatedly declared to him that he wants to hear that the solution of the jewish problem has ben postponed until after the war is over that being so the curent discusions are of purely theoretical value in mr reich minister lamers opinion he wil moreover take pains to ensure that whatever else hapens no fundamental decisions are taken without his knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party july unles some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the policy and i believe al the memos and actions taken by various people ie himler luther morgan etc instead tend to confirm the policy it apears that finding a memo with a hitler ie oficial conection to the holocaust is just a dream irving s or whatever amount sems safe i hope this memo can make it into the article he may have ben a nasty guy but honestly he was probably just a bureaucrat that sems to be the treatment he received after the war by people on the scene browsing reading the german language wikipedia i am not realy a god german reader but corect me if you are version of this article it apears they also avoid the relevant memo but of course they have the fear of prosecution over their heads in america our reluctance at least isn t legal finding the luther memo it apears this memo is of an even later date it is even more revealing as to what the policy toward jews was during the war al jews were to be expeled from europe after the war was over so it apears hitler was not talking gas chambers etc quite late in the war memos of this sort sem to crowd al the holocaust gasing etc into a very smal time frame an imposibly smal time frame probably why the memos are ignored by al right thinking people ps i just found out that the luther memo has a long history it has ben ignored since at least the i thought this was a relatively recent discovery by scholars etc it apears to just be an old unanswerable embarasment to the holocaust story thanks for pushing me to search harder one of the troubles with trying to hide or falsify history apears to be that it takes very litle work by very unknowledgeable people ie me to discover the truth i found most of the information that sems more plausible than the oficial story by just hiting enter on more than the the first page of search engine results ,0

64659,ad0df042c6d8e49b, as a result of the masacre in boston parliament began to consider a motion to partialy repeal the townshend duties most of the new taxes were repealed but the tax on tea was retained the british government continued in its atempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the boston tea party and the american revolution folowed folowing the seven years war the british empire was dep in debt to help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire the parliament of great britain british parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of british america previously through the trade and navigation acts parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire however with the sugar act of parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue american colonists initialy objected to the sugar act for economic reasons but before long they recognized that there were constitutional isues involved it was argued that the bil of rights protected british subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative parliament because the colonies elected no members of the british parliament many colonists viewed parliament s atempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent some british politicians countered this argument with the theory of virtual representation which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in parliament even though they elected no members this isue only briefly debated folowing the sugar act became a major point of contention folowing parliament s pasage of the stamp act the stamp act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies contributing to its repeal the folowing year along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised implicit in the stamp act dispute was an isue more fundamental than taxation and representation the question of the extent of parliament s authority in the colonies parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the stamp act in by simultaneously pasing the declaratory act which proclaimed that parliament could legislate for the colonies in al cases whatsoever contents townshend s program raising revenue enforcing compliance reaction boycots unrest in boston partial repeal notes references further reading external links townshend s program raising revenue the first of the townshend acts sometimes simply known as the townshend act was the revenue act of this act represented the chatham ministry s new aproach for generating tax revenue in the american colonies after the repeal of the stamp act in the british government had goten the impresion that because the colonists had objected to the stamp act on the grounds that it was a direct or internal tax colonists would therefore acept indirect or external taxes such as taxes on imports with this in mind charles townshend the chancelor of the exchequer devised a plan that placed new duties on paper paint lead glas and tea that were imported into the colonies these were items that were not produced in north america and that the colonists were only alowed to buy from great britain the british government s belief that the colonists would acept external taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the stamp act the colonists objection to internal taxes did not mean that they would acept external taxes the colonial position was that any tax laid by parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional townshend s mistaken belief that americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional wrote historian john philip reid was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the revolution the townshend revenue act received the royal asent on june there was litle oposition expresed in parliament at the time never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet pasage wrote historian peter thomas the revenue act was pased in conjunction with the indemnity act of which was intended to make the tea of the british east india company more competitive with smugled dutch tea the indemnity act repealed taxes on tea imported to england alowing it to be re exported more cheaply to the colonies this tax cut in england would be partialy ofset by the new revenue act taxes on tea in the colonies the revenue act also reafirmed the legality of writs of asistance or general search warants which gave customs oficials broad,0

75935,cb3129119ad00df9,another point to be examined regarding the controversial interpretations of the ny times story is the interpretation of this key paragraph where picard s name is mentioned along with two other scientists the unspoken and unexamined implication or asumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as tour picard and skel are acurately described by the di s claim that they are anti evolution disenters from darwin and also suporters of the di s political agenda deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position did chang intentionaly put that paragraph into his story to afirm the di s characterization of those thre scientists or did chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader s mind on the di s incredulous claim that al signers adhered to the di s characterization of the signers given that chang reported both the di s claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of suport and disdain among the petition signers a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading chang s article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question is the reader suposed to take at face value the di s naked claim that scientists such as those thre are anti evolution disenters from darwin who suport the di s political agenda or is the reader suposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the di stretch credulity the way the article is writen a casual reader could draw either conclusion a skeptical or fair minded reader could also draw the conclusion that no firm conclusion can be drawn as to whether any of the signers fit the di s characterization of them as anti evolution disenters from darwin who suport the di s political agenda what conclusion did the various wikipedia editors draw and how do they justify treating any such conclusion as an established fact for the purpose of crafting authentic biographies of figures such as tour picard or skel ,0

36378,612af5ab69773252, jesus s name hi i apreciate al your questions and wish to understand the mater if you realy want to know why the article for most of its life has not included anything about jesus hebrew name or aramaic name in the lead i encourage you to lok at the talk page archives as we had at least two lengthy discusions when two times in the past someone proposed this what bothers me about the curent situation is someone changed the long standing consensus version without any such discusion did you know that many pharises who lived around the time of jesus had grek names or grek derived names grek names speled out in hebrew leters tarfon antigonus abtalion these are actualy names of rabis recorded in the mishnah who probably spoke aramaic on a daily basis and hebrew in their studies the mishnah is writen in hebrew yet they had grek or helenized names alexander was a popular name at this time this of course does not mean that jesus was given a grek name rather than a hebrew name or a helenized hebrew name when he was born we have no idea it probably is not likely but we have no idea this is not my point but one brought up by many editors who have made major contributions to the jesus article i think it is prety standard practice throughout wikipedia that when an article wishes to adres a complex isues perhaps because it is controversial or there are many diverse views or it is speculative or for whatever reason requires time to explain to readers why there is no certainty why it is not a fact we do not shy away from such topics but rather adres them in the body of the article but not in the lede for very obvious reasons we do not mention in the lede everything that is in the body i don t object to including speculation in the article but until someone aded this stuf sometime in the past month there was a consensus among al the editors who had made major contributions to the article not to put this speculation in the lead talk ,0

111364,53d8265f47fe607e, a reaction to the above coment some god points here some of which are acounted for very wel on the page about the swp us it sems beter that this entry on barnes remain focused on barnes himself rather than the swp dictatorship or democracy it s an excelent point to say that it s pointles and misleading to demonise barnes clearly there was a qualitative change in the politics of the swp during the barnes clearly played a leading role in this proces but had the national comite majority behind him most would also say that the swp organisational and democratic norms changed those who were expeled such as the fourth international tendency argued it was done undemocraticaly and wrong headedly breaking with trotskyism this sems a fair description of the swp s evolution however if the swp fel it unfair it would be beter to write of a break with trotsky s theory of permanent revolution and the strugle to build the fourth international in so far as trotsky agres with the leninism and oposition to stalinism and the third period the swp agre with him however trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that trotsky and the swp founded the fi the defining aspects of that movement permanent revolution in the developing world anti bureaucratic revolution in the workers states and the notion of socialist democracy of course the swp no longer cals itself trotskyist and the word is droped for example from the title of joseph hansen s bok on cuba castroism similary it is mistaken to cal the swp a castoist party the swp s new international strategy in the and was one of convergence with the castroist curent however it s clear that the swp has its own ideology jack barnes australian ,0

25187,42a5cbad98e42486, jack a roe thank you for responding that article says any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation that raises a question in writing the article i paraphrased the material wel some of it it sems to me that paraphrasing is necesary when conveying information i mean seth roberts published boks and when they discused a topic it was discused in depth so my question is is paraphrasing considered to be interpretation to me it is not interpretation but others might say it is it would sem that verbal thinks i am interpreting instead of paraphrasing but since he isn t a knowledgeable editor meaning an editor with knowledge of the subject mater i don t se how he can know that verbal acting on the asumption that i have ben interpreting instead of paraphrasing has ben trying to block any new primary sources that i might ad now the article also says that primary sources must be used with care but it doesn t say that they can t be used in abundance in a case like this i don t se why the sections that describe the material can t be abundantly sourced to the seth boks i realy do have a handicap when it comes to finding secondary sources what i ve ben caling third party sources up to now i have always ben interested in the seth material not metaphysics in general thus i have almost al the seth boks but few other boks on metaphysical subjects where references to seth roberts might ocur i do have many cayce and casteneda boks but they don t say a thing about seth finding more secondary sources is dificult for me because my town has a smal library and you l be amazed by this i don t have a car to drive to the nearest city however it sems to me that given the sale of milion boks and the secondary references that are already in the article notability has already ben established because i was the only person here who was able to kep reverting verbal s cuts to the article i am now being acused of edit waring there s the posibility that i won t be around to prevent verbal from chop chop choping at the article that being the case i hope you l stick around ,0

84002,e0d197ed0f5754bb, i realy don t care al that much about the jewish lists and categories i ve voted on some of them mostly because other editors have solicited my input i think with more confidence in what i would opine than is merited my votes on those have ben mixed and have depended on how specific the topics are and whether i think they can be done in an encyclopedic fashion but i m neither one of those people who votes kep for anything with the word jewish in it nor am i an editor who votes delete whenever i se the word we have some of each and i think both are acting with a bit of bad faith i am however very ofended by abuse of the administrative systems of wp in violation of wp point i gues you re a newbie and are perhaps not entirely aware of procedures we al start out that way in actual fact there is a criteria for spedy deletion that alows removal of pages that have ben previously deleted by afd there are a lot of rules floating around and they are not al consistent with each other so you can certainly be forgiven for not knowing al or even most of them but an afd is for a very specific thing and something very diferent from your spurious nomination fwiw arniep also violated wp point by masively nominating jewish fo lists that he actualy wanted kept and he got blocked for hours rightly as a warning what an afd is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from wikipedia it is not a way to expres displeasure with particular editors of that page it is not a way to push the idea that the page would be beter if modified in some fashion and it is not a way to get even with editors who voted delete on some other page that you believe is conceptualy equivalent to the page you nominate there are lots of pages that i think should be beter and where i think the editors are puting in material that is not encyclopedic and where the structure of the article is not optimal maybe it neds refactoring into subpages as a god wp citizen who folows wikiquete i raise those isues on the article talk pages i atempt edits to the page directly perhaps i create a temporary version of the page that more closely fits what i think it should be like what i do not do is nominate pages that i think cover worthwhile topics for afd as a way of bulying the editors whose edits i do not like if you folow wikiquete you l get along with people here and be a productive editor if you violate it you l make lots of enemies increase general animosity and fail to get anything done your start so far has not ben portentious but you certainly have time left to learn and to make amends ,0

125886,a15bc43c055ae574, i have repeatedly expresed the opinion that the most idiotic as oposed to merely lazy thing that tyson has ben revealed to have done was to listen to bush s biblical quotation and write a note to himself which in the event he was to lazy to locate to the efect aparently that bush had clowned himself by taking credit for star names that were actualy arabic so since i wrote the words you complain about it should be obvious that they are not intended to make tyson sem in any way corect i would be in favor of making this clearer by quoting someone to the efect that atributing to isaiah the intent to take credit for star charts drawn up a milenia after isaiah s death is profoundly stupid but i was in a hury to replace a vacancy on the page and an apropriate source didn t spring to mind in any case i am adamantly oposed to the change you propose since it removes al specifics leaving a tasteles gruel and i don t se anything particularly encyclopedic about bad writing the bit about yahweh is directly from tyson s acknowledgement of eror on facebok btw where he stil shows no inkling of how moronic his interpretation of bush s biblical quotation is ,0

48622,820781105b608119, on the creator the demiurge is an expresion of philosophy in that it is a grek or helenistic cultural concept this means that the demiurge is a cultural concept from the greks who did not believe in the empirical existence of nothingnes as non substantive ex nihilo they treated nothingnes as a substance caled aether the greks as pagans and pagan philosophers did not believe that you can get nothing from something therefore the creator had to create from something plato it was the god aristotle it was energy plotinus it was force these are ontological noema that create consciousnes in humans this arises from the unique esence of grek or helenistic philsophy treating the natural physic and supernatural metaphysic as extensions of human consciousnes so everything that can be talked about or experienced stems from human consciousnes and therefore must be expresed from a anthropomorphic perspective god or gods can not be anything outside of human that s why zeus and the gods are flawed as their flaws reflect in man and mankinds flaws reflect in them the demiurge as a phrase is creator and nothing can be created but in the way that mankind creates the grek orthodox christian god is not relatiable to the actus et potentia as the roman catholic god since god in esence is not action or inaction or potential nor inpotential this would make god s being esence or substance comprehenisible and that then is not the ortohodox christian god the christian god is not one the monad or unity acording to st dionysus the areopagite orthodox christianity did not have the same god therefore the concept of god uses and has familiar language betwen helenstic grek and byzantine grek but in esence substance is a diferent concept of god in grek orthodox christianity which iamblichus kinda tried to graft into neoplatonism after the fact god is in and outside the universe god is made up of a substance that is beyond substance since god s consciousnes ontologicaly is hyper being meaning that god as a substance can not be detected nor contained now this was dependent on the concept of hypostasis imanence or existence cataphatic the pagan philosophical god was a detectable substance that al things derive from and reduced to the orthodox christian god is a hyper substance that is not empiricaly detectable mankind has to be altered in order to detect it since the god in grek orthodox christianity in his trinitarian completenes uncreatednes does not have the same consciousnes as mankind did not share mankinds consciousnes until he became a human being aka jesus christ the reverse is only true in philosophy since in orthodox christianity god as a whole has a consciousnes which is completely unrelatable to mankind philosophy god and mankind have the same consciousnes and roman catholicism and protestantism treat god ontologicaly very much as modalistic like sabelianism which creates also a diferent consciousnes orthodox christianity also rejects this as anthropomorphic izing the christian god which can only come from not actualy having experiencing the christian god theoria and only experiencing the template in your brain or intrinsic god of philosophy ,0

52845,8d44aff4191440ac, maba diakhou b i first came acros the maba diakhou b article when i was loking for articles relating to senegambia having read the view history section of the article it was evident that it has ben on display for quite a few years now the purpose of starting this discusion is to disagre with several aspects of the historical acount being presented in the maba diakhou b article based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy although i have primary documents about the man maba diakhou b i wil stick to secondary sources in line with wiki s policy before i start to put forward my counter argument i think a brief history is necesary for those who are not wel familiar with the subject maba was a senegambian jihadist in the century who spent years launching wars against non muslim kingdoms in order to convert them to islam as it wil become clearer you wil find out that converting people to islam was not his only objective for launching jihad in any case he was partly responsible for the mas conversion of the senegambian people particularly the wolof people and other tribes in the century this is very significant because senegambia which encompases senegal and the gambia are predominantly muslim countries the muslim population are the descendants of those converted in mases in the century many of whom by maba diakhou b islam being very strong in both senegal and the gambia especialy with the advent of the muslim brotherhods of senegal maba diakhou b is given a saint like figure in both senegal and the gambia as such no one dares to coment on the atrocities of maba his back handed dealings with the french and british administration during the colonial era his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non muslims his pilaging of lands etc instead the muslim majority of senegambia led by the muslim brotherhods of senegal have fabricated his historical acount and pas it of as facts that some historians have falen for but of course there are others who wil not be duped and have examined the true facts and writen it acordingly it is very important to point out here that not al ordinary senegambian muslims fel this way many of them try to go about their daily lives with litle thought for these kind of things there are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infalible even if ample evidence is presented to them in most cases when i talk about the senegambian muslim mases i am refering to the senegambian muslim establishment who mingle in politics control what historical or religious programes are presented in the media etc these are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe having said al that i now adres each of the inacurate acounts presented in maba s article maba was kiled on the july at the batle of fandane thiouthiogne comonly known in senegambian history as the batle of somb he was kiled by the serer people led by their king bur sine kumba ndofene famak jof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the serer people as he had done with other non muslim tribes and kingdoms sources histoire du sine saloum by alioune sar and esai sur l histoire du saloum et du rip by abdou bouri b the article did not give us the exact date he died and in the death and legacy heading made a transitional eror as to the year he died by puting instead of i wil also adres that section of the article later especialy in relation to the first paragraph in the first paragraph of this article it says and i quote he became leader almamy in saloum and under the resistance and conquest heading in other words resisting french colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading it states and i quote while he eventualy suceded in overtaking the dynasty of saloum his movement never suceded in sine kingdom of sine and much of serer teritory remained animist or christian into the century first of al maba was nothing more than an almamy in rebelion he was not a king with al the powers of a king and him overthrowing the serer dynasty of saloum has not ben acurately narated in this article which i wil delve in later note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading the article talks about how maba founded nioro du rip but it did not tel us in any part of the article how he founded it just like in the whole article important pieces of information has ben,0

73928,c5c82fa1836a82aa,i agre with you wikipedia does ned to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web encyclopedia here was something i said in the talk page of the a more perfect union i believe that most of time the argument is about this main isue of is wikipedia is being used for publicity and not an argument about whether it is just an encyclopedia of important events or topics ocuring or ocured i am sure once the presidential race is over there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever and people discusing about this spech would be doing so solely because of its content its linguistic delivery and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons most of the times people are forgoten but what they have done or said makes them remembered today there are milion gogle hits for the i have a dream spech and milion for martin luther king but only milion hits for i have a dream martin luther king search sugesting that many people especialy in non american countries perhaps would know the spech but not even knowing who said it in the first place by contrast there are only milion hits for a more perfect union barack obama thousand hits for barack obama spech on race but milion hits for barack obama my argument is that i implore wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to kep wikipedia non publicity and solely information because by deleting articles some wikipedia editors find is ading publicty to one person named barack obama they are also deleting something which is so much potentialy informational for many other bilions of people who just want information on this particular spech i say let the people decide how they filter their information because the election only objectively afects milion americans but the race isue afects everybody on the planet and this spech is a key spech on that mater msethisuwan talk ,0

7408,13b29b6dbc86d588,lok a lenghty exchange of opinions can be a nice thing but since you two have now discused the rough equivalent of pages this discusion is obviously staled let me try to sum up what i think about this topic please be aware that wp at like any other wp policy isn t writen in stone and saltyboatr s extremely literal interpretation of one sentence of this policy is most likely not what it was meant to say every article published in foreign afairs is reviewed by other scientists which is much more than you could say for any reliable newspaper or just about every university publication that should be enough to make sure wp at isn t a god reason to ban them i have to agre with ultramarine if you use your interpretation of wp at consequently there s only a handful of wp articles that would survive the necesary mas deletion of references what s more i think it would be some prety bad ones those that rely entirely on newspaper articles finaly there realy is no god reason why articles that i could use in every political science paper and any scientific article shouldn t be enough for wikipedia ,0

124456,99c96f41e8b993cc, islamic science there s ben some discusion previously of the ned for an article on the history of islamic science at present there is a smal section of that sort in the article on islamic science there s a real potential for tension there because two diferent groups are interested in the topic of islamic science and these two groups define it in very diferent ways i am concerned that the diferent asumptions of these two groups may lead to unecesary conflict which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two the article islamic science sems to have ben founded by advocates of a modern intelectual movement caled islamic science which seks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional islamic religious norms thus the article defines islamic science as science in the context of traditional religious ideas of islam including its ethics and philosophy a muslim engaged in this field is caled a muslim scientist this is not the same as science as conducted by muslims in the secular context my emphasis historians of science on the other hand find this definition excesively constraining since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecesors it realy doesn t mater to historians of science whether the particular scientist was muslim e g al khwarizmi sabian e g thabit ibn qura christian e g hunain ibn ishaq or jewish e g hasdai ibn shaprut whether he advocated strict adherence to muslim traditions e g al ghazali or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers e g avero s or whether he worked in a religious or secular context if he studied natural phenomena and worked within the islamic world his work fits the historians broader definition of islamic science these contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more diferent ways when historians wish to discus scholars who don t folow traditional islamic religious norms while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discusion when advocates of the modern islamic science movement wish to discus those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in islamic cultures rather than go this unhapy route i propose an amicable divorce removing the section on the history of islamic science perhaps renamed history of science in islam and making it a separate article under the history of science portal and leaving the remaining article on islamic science as part of the series of articles on islam ,0
